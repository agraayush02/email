( of course ,  because of the $ 15 , 000 / year limit , i have to spread my gifts over several  years in order to get the total amount matched by enron . )  sherry benton , the librarian in spearman just called and gave me the great  news that the $ 20 , 000 in community donations has been achieved . in fact , i  expect that the total community number will come to almost $ 25 , 000 once all  of the donations are received .  in order to recognize our part in all this , the mayor of the town is planning  to declare october 17 th as \" stinson gibner and enron day \" in spearman , and  they would like to have some public ceremony to bestow this recognition .  there will be coverage by the local radio station and newspaper and ,  possibly , by the amarillo newspaper as well .  they are asking if a representative from enron ( other than myself ) would be  interested in coming to spearman for this event . please let me know if you  or anyone else would be interested in doing this . spearman is about a 90  minute drive north from the airport in amarillo , and it is possible to get  there and back to houston on the same day .  thanks ,  stinson gibner  x 34748  p . s . is there any possibility of getting a one time raise on the $ 15 , 000 / year  matching cap so that i can have $ 40 , 000 matched in just two years instead of  three ?  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by stinson gibner / hou / ect on 09 / 20 / 2000  02 : 01 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  stinson gibner  05 / 05 / 2000 11 : 47 am  to : cindy olson / corp / enron @ enron  cc :  subject : thanks  cindy ,  i just received notification of enron ' s match of my $ 8000 donation to the  hansford county library in spearman , texas . ( all old pipeline hands know  spearman because both northern natural and transwestern pipelines run near by  the city . )  you may be interested to know what i am trying to accomplish there . the  library is one of the few independent public libraries in the state of texas  as it is owned neither by the county nor city . it ' s budget is met through a  combination of city , county , and private contributions . a big part of their  income comes from the \" thrift shop , \" spearman ' s version of the blue bird  circle . in order to help the library continue to provide quality services  to the community ( our library in spearman , population 3000 , is by all  accounts much better than the one in nearby perryton , population 15000 ) , i  am trying to help the library establish an endowment fund . we have set a  goal of raising $ 100 , 000 over the next 3 years . with enron ' s matching , i am  planning to provide about $ 80 , 000 of that amount with the other $ 20 , 000  coming from contributions from others in the local community .  i am also investigating if the library can get any type of matching grant  from other foundations , but it looks like most prefer to fund specific  projects rather than put funds towards endowments . let me know if you have  any suggestions for us .  thanks ,  stinson  x 34748</th>\n",
